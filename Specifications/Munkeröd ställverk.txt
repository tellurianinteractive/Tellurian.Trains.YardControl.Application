What do you think of the follwoing solution: drop the special command line app, and run the NumericKeypadControllerInputs as a background service in the web app. Then the web app can capture keyboard keystrokes at document level and via an implementation of IKeyReader forward this to the background NumericKeypadControllerInputs, that sets points, train routes and locks etc. 
This means moving all of the business logic and the interface definitions to the Model project (and Web project where appropriate).
We also need a way to translate user clicks into a seqience of IKeyReader events. These events should be deferred until the gui clicks produces something that can be sent. One idea can be to extend IKeyReader to accept an array of ConsoleKeyInfo, but still support reading one key at a time, IKeyReaderWithBuffer.

Using the GUI:
- Coloring of signals: Signals should have two background colour states: red (stop) and green (go). When signal feedback later will be added, colours should reflect the generat state of the signal. The signals should have white text for maxmal contrast.
Below my thoughts 
- Set a train route: 
1 Click on the initial signal, it must be red to be a starting point for a train route. 
2 Click on the final signal, it must be red to be a ending point for a train route.
3 Send keyboard command {initial}.{final} Note we always use the dot-separated format. Example: 21.31
4 Present feedback in the YardView (propably a separate component that subscribes to the notifications from the background service)

- Set train route via intermediate signal
1 Click on the initial signal, it must be red to be a starting point for a train route. 
2 Hold shift down and click on one or several middle signals.
3 Click on the final signal, it must be red to be a ending point for a train route.
4 Send keyboard command {initial}.{middle}.{final} Note we always use the dot-separated format. Example 21.33.37

- Cancel a train route
1 CTRL + click on final signal in route.
2 Send keyboard kommand {signal}/ example 65/


When finding a train route path, there is a limitation: finding the train route is either forward or backwards links, never a path that traverse links in different dirctions.
When clicking on signals, if the first has odd number, the rest must also be odd numbers. Same for even: only even signal numbers. 
Following signals should only be clickable if they  are reachable via graph links from the previous signal selected.

It seems that we use ILogger and ILoggerFactory inconsistent. Is there a way to use either ILogger or ILoggerFactory and have a consistent use? 
Its also a good practice to inject external dependecies thorugh the constructor, and not create instances hidden in classes.
